Having practiced dentistry since 1994, she has been through several post graduate courses in different fields of dentistry since receiving her Doctor of Dental Surgery degree. Dr. Connie is a second generation dentist, following in her mother’s footsteps, Dr. Maria Kais.\\nDr. Connie was born and raised in San Jose and is a graduate of Presentation High School. She earned a B.S. degree in Biological Sciences from Loyola Marymount University. After graduating from dental school, Dr. Connie worked with underprivledged children in restoring their dental health. She brings this experience to her own dental practice which allows her to treat children with ease and great care. “It is a wonderful feeling to see a smiling child leave the office after having a great experience.” It is with the same gentle approach that Dr. Connie treats her adult patients as well. “Having the opportunity to relieve a patient from either physical and/or emotional pain gives me great satisfaction. Being able to develop a trusting and caring relationship with all of my patients is extremely rewarding”.\\n\\nDr. Kais has a wide range of experience in different areas of dentistry, from cosmetic and restorative dentistry to surgical and root canal treatments and denture prosthetics. Dr. Kais is a certified LANAP provider. After extensive training, Dr. Kais is among an elite group of practitioners trained specifically for this revolutionary treatment of periodontitis. The LANAP therapy utilizes a dental laser to reduce gum pocket depths responsible for gum disease and tooth loss. “This technology is truly amazing. I am so pleased to offer my patients a comfortable alternative to gum surgery that produces minimal pain and discomfort without using conventional cutting and stitching.The fear factor which often prevents patients from following through with periodontal treatment is eliminated.Her approach to your treatment starts with patiently listening to you. Then, after a complete and thorough examination, she reviews and discusses the diagnosis and treatment options with you.”I enjoy the challenges of comprehensive dental care along with the professional and personal relationships that develop with my patients. I am proud to provide my patients with the best in dental technology, treatment options and patient comfort.”\",\n                    \"city_id\": 11,\n                    \"college\": \"Loyola Marymount University\",\n                    \"degree\": \"BS\",\n                    \"gender\": \"female\",\n                    \"id\": 177,\n                    \"image_url\": \"https://asset2.betterdoctor.com/images/528682704214f803bd000798-1_thumbnail.jpg\",\n                    \"insurance_plans\": \"Delta Dental PPO, Delta Dental Premier, First Dental Health, MetLife PDP, BC CA Dental Blue 100200300, Aetna DPPO, Emblem Dental -

She was raised in the country town of Springtown, Texas, near Fort Worth, attended Baylor University, graduating cum laude earning a B.S. in Biology with minors in Spanish and Chemistry, and earned her medical degree at Texas A&M College of Medicine Health Science Center.  April’s passion for women’s health began early in medical school. During class she remembers reading ahead in the physiology texts, excited about endocrinology, the reproductive systems, and their complex pathways.  She gained her first exposure to Obstetrical care through volunteer work providing prenatal care to an indigent population with a team of nurse practitioners and midwives.\\nApril completed her Obstetrics and Gynecology residency at Saint Louis University, the first medical school west of the Mississippi to award a medical degree.  There she was involved with the Women’s Evaluation Unit Committee and medical student education. After having her son during her third year of training, she was able to balance motherhood while also completing a research project.  Her research project investigated the causes and outcomes of late preterm delivery with a focus on finding preventable ways to avoid premature birth.  She was invited to present her data at the ACOG National convention and also won third place in the St. Louis Gynecological Society’s Annual Scientific Meeting.

\"bio\": \"Boasting a long family history in Fort Worth, Dr. Perkins’ mother claims he always wanted to be a doctor.  While not so sure this was the case, Dr. Perkins’ nonetheless began hospital volunteer work as a youngster and at grade school, was made to believe becoming a doctor was an insurmountable task. Years passed and through diligence and dedication, Dr. Perkins entered medical school at UT in Houston.  There began his road to achieving board certifications in internal, critical care, pulmonary and sleep medicine. \\n\\nDr. Raymond Perkins is glad to bring his expertise in pulmonary and sleep medicine to North Texas Lung and Sleep Clinic.  Prior to joining forces with Dr. David Ostransky, founding physician at the clinic, Dr. Perkins completed his residency in pulmonary medicine at the University of Texas Medical School at Houston in 1991.  Directly out of fellowship, he accomplished significant research in lung macrophage function, having a special interest in the cellular biology of lung disease, and achieved board certification in sleep medicine in 2000.  The multi-specialty nature of sleep medicine is attractive to Dr. Perkins, especially as it relates to sleep disordered breathing.  Boarded in sleep medicine by two organizations and awarded multiple research grants, Dr. Perkins values keeping current with progress in all areas of his certifications. \\n\\n“I believe that the patient deserves to have a physician who is not only committed to excellent medical care, but also to keeping abreast of the latest medical knowledge.  I try to practice medicine in a collaborative fashion, providing the patient with the best medical advice for them to use to make the best decisions about their health.  But, I am not afraid to guide the patient when they feel they are overwhelmed with information and situations.” \\n\\nAs Dr. Perkins’ medical practices evolved over time, so have his personal interests.  A loving husband of thirty years (he claims his wife deserves a medal) and father to two young adult children, Dr. Perkins’ enjoys scuba diving.  You can even find him instructing the sport himself!  Guitar and running are the latest developing passions. \\n\\nTwenty years of experience yield Dr. Perkins’ an approach he believes patients appreciate.  North Texas Lung and Sleep Clinic is proud to welcome him to its fine team of providers.\",\n                    \"city_id\": 14,\n                    \"college\": null,\n                    \"degree\": null,\n                    \"gender\": \"male\",\n                    \"id\": 1984,\n                    \"image_url\": \"https://asset3.betterdoctor.com/images/5369bcde4214f8161b0004fc-1_thumbnail.jpg\",\n                    \"insurance_plans\": \"PHCS PPO, Aetna Signature Administrators PPO, Aetna Choice POS II, Multiplan PPO, Humana ChoiceCare Network PPO, Aetna HMO, CIGNA Open Access Plus, Aetna Managed Choice POS Open Access, CIGNA HMO, Scott and White PPO, BCBS Blue Card PPO, CIGNA PPO, Humana Preferred PPO, CIGNA LocalPlus, BCBS TX BlueChoice, Great West PPO, UHC Choice Plus POS, UHC Navigate HMO, UHC Navigate POS, UHC Options PPO, First Health PPO\",\n                    \"latitude\": 32.93942,\n                    \"longitude\": -97.14064,\n                    \"name\": \"Raymond Perkins\",\n                    \"phone\": \"8177317046\",\n                    \"rating\": null,\n                    \"specialty_id\": 630,\n                    \"state\": \"TX\",\n                    \"street\": \"731 E Southlake Blvd\",\n                    \"title\": \"MD\",\n                    \"zip_code\": 76092\n                },\n                {\n                    \"address_city\": \"Dallas\",\n                    \"bio\": \"Dr. Darren Nelson, MD--specialist in pediatric emergency medicine and emergency medicine pediatric emergency medicine--currently treats patients in Dallas, Texas and Arlington, Texas.\\n\\nDr. Nelson is licensed to practice medicine at Texas.\\n\\nIn addition to having active medical licenses, Dr. Nelson has passed an automated background check which looked at elements including medical license status and malpractice screening (no history found).\",\n                    \"city_id\": 14,\n                    \"college\": null,\n                    \"degree\": null,\n                    \"gender\": \"male\",\n                    \"id\": 2047,\n                    \"image_url\": \"https://asset3.betterdoctor.com/assets/general_doctor_male.png\",\n                    \"insurance_plans\": \"CIGNA Open Access Plus, CIGNA HMO, CIGNA LocalPlus, CIGNA PPO, Advantage 6350 - HIX, Basic - HIX, Medicare, Great West PPO, First Health PPO\",\n                    \"latitude\": 32.91454,\n                    \"longitude\": -96.77286,\n                    \"name\": \"Darren Nelson\",\n                    \"phone\": \"2142171920\",\n                    \"rating\": null,\n                    \"specialty_id\": 597,\n                    \"state\": \"TX\",\n                    \"street\": \"12221 Merit Dr\",\n                    \"title\": \"MD\",\n                    \"zip_code\": 75251\n                },\n                {\n                    \"address_city\": \"Plano\",\n                    \"bio\": \"Dr. John Lawson, MD practices medicine at Grapevine, Texas, Waxahachie, Texas, Plano, Texas, and Flower mound, Texas, specializing in cardiovascular disease and internal medicine.\\n\\nDr. Lawson is licensed to see patients in Texas.\\n\\nDr. Lawson has passed an automated background check which looked at elements including medical license status and malpractice screening (no history found).\",\n                    \"city_id\": 14,\n                    \"college\": null,\n                    \"degree\": null,\n                    \"gender\": \"male\",\n                    \"id\": 2120,\n                    \"image_url\": \"https://asset1.betterdoctor.com/assets/general_doctor_male.png\",\n                    \"insurance_plans\": \"MD Bronze Silver  Gold - HMO, MD Bronze Silver  Gold - HMO, CIGNA LocalPlus, Aetna Choice POS II, PHCS PPO, Aetna HMO, Aetna Signature Administrators PPO, CIGNA PPO, CIGNA Open Access Plus, Aetna Managed Choice POS Open Access, BCBS Blue Card PPO, Scott and White PPO, Humana ChoiceCare Network PPO, Humana Preferred PPO, BCBS TX BlueChoice, Great West PPO, UHC Choice Plus POS, UHC Navigate HMO, UHC Navigate POS, UHC Options PPO, First Health PPO, Aetna Managed Choice POS Open Access, Aetna HMO, Humana ChoiceCare Network PPO, Aetna Signature Administrators PPO, Aetna Choice POS II, UHC Choice Plus POS, UHC Navigate HMO, UHC Navigate POS, UHC Options PPO, First Health PPO\",\n                    \"latitude\": 33.045027,\n                    \"longitude\": -96.837372,\n                    \"name\": \"John Lawson\",\n                    \"phone\": \"4698004410\",\n                    \"rating\": null,\n                    \"specialty_id\": 591,\n                    \"state\": \"TX\",\n                    \"street\": \"6300 W Parker Rd\",\n                    \"title\": \"MD\",\n                    \"zip_code\": 75093\n                },\n                {\n                    \"address_city\": \"Euless\",\n                    \"bio\": \"Dr.Anding is from Louisiana.

Stacy Le was raised in Foxboro, Massachusetts. From a young age she loved medicine and yearned to one day become a physician. Because of this interest, she became the youngest certified CPR instructor in the country at the age of sixteen. She also had the opportunity to work as a phlebotomist drawing patients’ blood at the famous Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston during college as her college job. She attended Brandeis University taking premedical courses and majoring in Sociology and graduating in 1988. Dr. Le decided to attend medical school at the University of South Carolina School of Medicine in Columbia, SC in order to be closer to her mother’s family who resided in South Carolina and received her MD degree in 1988. She completed her residency program in Internal Medicine in 1991 at the Brown University Program in Medicine in Providence, RI (a program that was nationally recognized for its excellence in training for Primary Care) in 1991.\\n\\nBefore opening Progressive Medical Associates (a non-hospital affiliated private medical practice) in 2004, Dr. Le practiced in Massachusetts for thirteen years and served on numerous hospital committees and participated in medical residency training. She was appointed Clinical Instructor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School. Additionally, she has earned the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue Quality Award in recognition of outstanding results in primary care (only one of forty-one physicians in the state of Massachusetts to earn this privilege) as well as the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts Excellence in Primary Care Award. She has also earned the American Medical Association’s Physician Recognition Award, the Congressional Medal of Distinction, and United Healthcare Premium Quality and Efficiency of Care distinction. She and Dr. Peter Le served as town physicians in Medway, Massachusetts as well as physicians for the Medway Public School System. Dr. Stacy Le is board certified in Internal Medicine and, in fact, has passed the rigorous recertification examinations required every ten years by the American Board of Internal Medicine, most recently in 2011.\\n\\nBecause of patient interest in non-invasive cosmetic procedures and her desire to ensure that these procedures were performed to a high level of medical standards, Dr. Le sought training in the cosmetic use of Botox and Dermal Fillers (such as Juvederm and Restylane) in Atlanta in 2009. She subsequently completed training for advanced cosmetic procedures as well. Thus, she can offer her patients safe and effective options if they desire the wonderfully easy and effective options that are now available without wondering about the quality of the person administering the therapy.\",\n                    \"city_id\": 17,\n                    \"college\": \"University of South Carolina School of Medicine\",\n                    \"degree\": \"MD\",\n

He went on to graduate at the top of his class in medical school at the University of Oklahoma and was inducted into the prestigious Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society. He then moved to Louisville in 2005 where he completed his General Surgery internship as well as his Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery residency. During his time at the University of Louisville, he was invited each year to present his clinical research at national meetings in the fields of Pediatric ENT and Otology.\\n\\n\\nDr. Allison has been with Advanced ENT and Allergy since 2010. He is board certified in adult/pediatric otolaryngology and facial plastic surgery by the American Board of Otolaryngology – he truly enjoys and is proficient in all aspects of ear, nose, and throat surgery. His love for children and pediatric care is a large reason he chose this specialty, and as a parent he knows how stressful it can be to have a sick child. He has a special interest in the medical and surgical management of sinus disease, and he fully understands the importance of addressing allergy as an underlying component of these problems. He is one of few ENT physicians in the area who has completed both written/oral examinations to achieve fellow status in the American Academy of Otolaryngic Allergy. He is also fully certified in minimally invasive balloon sinuplasty and regularly performs these procedures in the office. Other areas of interest include the diagnosis and surgical management of salivary gland, thyroid, and parathyroid disorders. He is American College of Surgeons certified in head and neck ultrasound diagnosis and fine needle aspiration. Dr. Allison is a firm believer in taking the time to listen to each patient’s concerns and perspectives in deciding on a mutually agreeable and effective plan in that patient’s care.\\n\\nThough he was raised in Oklahoma and is still a diehard “Sooner”, Dr. Allison fell in love with the Louisville area and currently enjoys cheering on U of L Cardinal athletics throughout the year. His first love is his family – he and his wife Angela are proud parents of a lively 3 year old daughter. In his spare time he also enjoys live music, working out, traveling, and skiing.\\n\\nLearn more about me: http://www.advancedentandallergy.com/md-wesley-allison.php\",\n                    \"city_id\": 30,\n                    \"college\": \"University of Oklahoma College of Medicine\",\n                    \"degree\": \"MD\",\n                    \"gender\": \"male\",\n                    \"id\": 1510,\n                    \"image_url\": \"https://asset2.betterdoctor.com/images/538cccb24214f857ed0004a4-1_thumbnail.jpg\",\n                    \"insurance_plans\": \"Bluegrass Family Health PPO, Aetna Managed Choice POS Open Access, Aetna Choice POS II, Aetna Signature Administrators PPO, Aetna HMO, UHC Choice Plus POS, UHC Navigate HMO, UHC Navigate POS, UHC Options PPO, Sagamore Plus, First Health PPO, Aetna HMO, CIGNA Open Access Plus, CIGNA PPO, Aetna Managed Choice POS Open Access, Aetna Signature Administrators PPO, CIGNA HMO, Aetna Choice POS II, Bluegrass Family Health PPO, PHCS PPO, Anthem Blue Preferred HMO, BCBS Blue Card PPO, Anthem Blue Access PPO, HealthLink PPO, Multiplan PPO, Humana Preferred PPO, Humana ChoiceCare Network PPO, HAP Preferred PPO, Medicaid, MD Bronze Silver  Gold -
